### Hi 👋, I'm Damian 👨‍💻. 

Ever since I remember, I always loved tinkering and building. I'm constantly trying to build something new, but most of the time, you can find me either 3D modelling & printing, coding websites/apps/automation scripts or building yet another home automation that my girlfriend will have to put up with 😂. 

The list of my favourite tools/frameworks/things(?) is constantly evolving, but here are some of the ones I love playing with in no particular order: [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/), [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.co.uk/products/fusion-360/overview) and [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). And nothing delights me more than a well-crafted app, so here are some I couldn't/wouldn't live without: [CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com/), [Alfred 4](https://www.alfredapp.com/), [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/), [Timing](https://timingapp.com/), [Notion](https://notion.so) and [WayScript](https://wayscript.com/).
